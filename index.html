            <p>HTML is at the core of every web page. Behind every web page you've ever visited there is HTML code that
                your web browser uses to display elements like text, images and tables. </p>
            <p>Web browsers read HTML documents (containing HTML code) to display the resulting web page.</p>
            <p>An HTML document can include different elements such as text headings, paragraphs, images or tables.
                These elements are defined using different tags.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Elements">
            <header>Elements</header>
            <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
                To familiarize you, the tag is actually made up of these symbols: &lt; and &gt; </p>
            <p>Let's imagine a paragraph, for example, in Html it is indicated by the letter p, inside the tags (&lt;p
                &gt;). The paragraph content will be placed inside the opening and closing tags, like this:</p>
            <article> &lt;p &gt; paragraph content &lt;/p&gt;</article>
            <p>There are numerous elements that make up an HTML file that have the same structure: an opening tag before
                and a closing tag, after within the / symbol.</p>
            <p>However, there are elements in HTML called void elements, such as images and links, that do not strictly
                require closing tags because of their inherent structure. Experts claim that things like images and
                links do not need and/or cannot have content – they are just kind of pointers to an element that is
                installed in the page. See some examples;</p>
            <article> &lt;img src="img_girl.jpg"/&gt;</article>
            <p>In the example above, the image element (img) contains an src (source) attribute that indicates the
                source of the image to be included. It does not need, therefore, other content.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header>Attributes</header>
            <p>An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's
                opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value </p>
            <ul>

                <li>The name is the property you want to set, it appears after the element name inside the open tag,
                    and, without space the = signal</li>
                <li>The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within quotations,
                    after the = signal. </li>
            </ul>
            <article> Exemple &lt;p class="introduction" &gt; </article>
            <p>ATENTION: Attribute names and attribute values are case-insensitive.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Core_Attributes">
            <header>Core Attributes</header>

            <p> The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements (although not all) are</p>

            <table style="width:100%">
                <tr>
                    <th>Attribute</th>
                    <th>Definition</th>
                    <th>Example</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>ID</td>
                    <td>The ID attribute uniquely identifies an element within a document. No two elements can have the
                        same ID value in a single document. The attribute’s value must begin with a letter in the range
                        A-Z or a-z and may be followed by letters (A-Za-z), digits (0-9), hyphens (“-“), underscores
                        (“_”), colons (“:”), and periods (“.”). The value is case-sensitive.</td>
                    <td>&lt;p id="firstp">My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>CLASS</td>
                    <td>The CLASS attribute specifies the element to be a member of one or more classes. Classes allow
                        authors to define specific kinds of a given element, like style in CSS. The CLASS attribute
                        value is a space-separated list of class names. The value is case-sensitive.</td>
                    <td>&lt;p class="important">Paragraph with important information.&lt;/p&gt</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>LANG</td>
                    <td>The lang attribute allows you to indicate the main language used in a document, but this
                        attribute was kept in HTML only for backwards compatibility with earlier versions of HTML. This
                        attribute has been replaced by the xml:lang attribute in new XHTML documents.</td>
                    <td>&lt;html lang = "en"&gt;</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

        <section class="main-section" id="Src_attribute">
            <header>SRC Attribute</header>
            <p>The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to
                the image to be displayed: </p>

            <article> &lt;img src="img_girl.jpg"/&gt;</article>
            <p>There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Absolute URL -</b> Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example:
                    src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg"</li>
                <li><b>Relative URL - </b> Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not
                    include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page.
                    Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain.
                    Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".</li>
                <li>Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be
                    in
                    violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be
                    removed
                    or changed.</li>
